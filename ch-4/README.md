# Steps to execute this program
We learned how Kafka Streams captures information about the events it consumes, and how to leverage the remembered information (state) to perform more advanced stream processing tasks, including:
- [x] Performing a KStream-KTable join 
- [x] Rekeying messages to meet the co-partitioning requirements for certain join types 
- [x] Performing a KStream-GlobalKTable join 
- [x] Grouping records into intermediate representations (KGroupedStream, KGroupedTable) to prepare our data for aggregating 
- [x] Aggregating streams and tables 
- [x] Using the interactive queries to expose the state of our application using both local and remote queries
